# 24_load_balance_meter
Utilising HX711 module with Arduino Mega, a 24 channel load balance meter is able to be constructed. Load balance meter can be used to examine the weight of the items put on the load balance. 

Materials used:
1. Arduino MEGA
2. 3x I2C 20*6 LCD
3. 24 HX711 Module
4. Relay module
5. 3x Button

This is a complex example sketch for HX711 which contains various function and utilities. Construct the circuit according to the pin defination in the file. 
Upload the program to Arduino MEGA and use the balance meter to measure weight now.
